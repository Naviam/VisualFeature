# Connect DynamoDB

connect-dynamodb is a DynamoDB session store backed by the [aws-sdk](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js)

## Installation

	  $ npm install connect-dynamodb

## Options
  
  - `client` An existing AWS DynamoDB object you normally get from `new AWS.DynamoDB()`
  - `AWSConfigPath` Path to JSON document containing your [AWS credentials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/nodejs/latest/dg/configuration-guide.html#nodejs-dg-credentials-from-disk)
  - `table` DynamoDB server session table name
  - `prefix` Key prefix, defaulting to "sess"
  - `reapInterval` How often expired sessions should be cleaned up

## Usage

	var options = {
		// Name of the table you would like to use for sessions.
		// Defaults to 'sessions'
	  	table: 'myapp-sessions',
	
		// Path to AWS credentials
  	  	// Defaults to './aws-config.json'
		AWSConfigPath: './path/to/credentials.json',
	  
	  	// Optional. How often expired sessions should be cleaned up.
  	  	// Defaults to 600000 (10 minutes).
  	  	reapInterval: 600000
	};
	
	var connect = require('connect'),
		DynamoDBStore = require('connect-dynamodb')(connect);
	connect()
		.use(connect.cookieParser())
		.use(connect.session({ store: new DynamoDBStore(options), secret: 'keyboard cat'}))

 Or with [express](http://expressjs.com/)
 	
 	DynamoDBStore = require('connect-dynamodb')(express);
 	var app = express(
		express.cookieParser(), 
		express.session({ store: new DynamoDBStore(options), secret: 'keyboard cat'})
	);
