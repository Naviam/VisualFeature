Subject: Web Service Information


Our web service is completed and you will soon be able to begin sending test
XML to us. What we have set up is a web service that you will supply the
following 3 values:

GAP <- Store identifier
8126C8B19C <- Customer ID key
XML data as a string

Ex. webService.postXML("GAP", "8126C8B19C", msg)

Our Web Service address is
https://204.238.139.13/WebService/YORKService.asmx and the function is
called postXML

We are going to be using SSL in conjunction with the store ID key to enable
security. The Key will ensure that you are the only person that can post
data to us, you will need to hardcode this into your client app. The SSL
will handle encryption of the data being transferred including the key. One
thing to note about the SSL certificate is that currently we are using an
openSSL certificate which is not from a trusted CA such as Verisign. Also we
are only using a server certificate so you will not need to provide a client
certificate.

The security team is in the process of getting a CA server from Verisign, at
that point we will have a certified certificate and you can modify your
client to only accept certificates from trusted CA's.

If you post data to the web service today you will get an error because we
do not yet have the SSL port 443 open in the firewall to our web services
server. We will notify you when this port is open and you will successfully
be able to post XML.

Once you are able to post XML we will return a 1 on success and a 0 on
failure.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
